# Resistor-Capacitor-Classifier

A CNN based model to classify between pictures of resistors and capacitors implemented on Colaboratory's Jupyter Notebook. Data was downloaded with the download.py script and the main model definition is in the class.py code. The notebook fits and saves the model. The validation accuracy and loss of the final (extra) epoch in the output is the test set's accuracy and loss.
